# Smart Energy Manager 🏠🔋

This project simulates a household energy management system using Python classes. It calculates energy consumption from appliances, generation from solar panels, and evaluates the net energy balance and cost savings.

---

## 📌 Features

- Track multiple appliances (with power and usage hours)
- Track multiple solar panels (with watts and sun hours)
- Calculate:
  - Daily energy usage
  - Monthly energy costs
  - Daily solar generation
  - Monthly energy savings
  - Net energy gain/loss and total savings
- Visualize appliance usage with matplotlib
- Output detailed summary tables using pandas

---

## 🧰 Tools & Concepts Used

- **Python**: Classes, lists, loops, and methods
- **pandas**: Table creation and summary reporting
- **matplotlib**: Data visualization (bar charts)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required libraries (if not already):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the `smart_energy_manager.py` script in any Python environment

---

## 📊 Example Output

```
----- Home Energy Summary -----
Total Daily Usage: 4.32 kWh
Total Daily Generation: 6.6 kWh
Net Daily Energy: 2.28 kWh
Net Monthly Savings at 0.22 €/kWh: 28.84 €
```

Includes:
- Appliance and solar panel summaries
- Bar chart of daily appliance usage
